WATS 3030 - Intro to Javascript - Final Project

Tiles:
     - Next I will need to be looking at animations for the tiles.  Javascript animations can work off of event listeners, however, I would like to have them operate on a 'click'.
     
     - TODO - Add pictures for each tile
     - TODO - Add descriptions for each project
     - TODO - Price?
     - TODO - Add picture to the rear side of tile 
     
 Dropdowns:
    - So far, I have completed this section.  The idea is implemented, however, I would like to add some transition animation or some kind of indicator for the user.
    
    - TODO - Add transition
    - TODO - Box border for question and answer
