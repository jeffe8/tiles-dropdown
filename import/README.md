Hello World
====================

This is the source Hello World assignment repository for WATS 3010. You will find everything you need to complete the Hello World assignment here.

In order to complete the assignment, you must perform a series of tasks centered around getting used to working with Git and Github. Specifically, we are going to practice forking and cloning repositories, making branches, and how to use Github Pages.

To complete this assignment, you must complete the following steps:

1. Sign up to Github
2. Fork this repo into your personal Github account
3. Sign up to [Codenvy.io](https://codenvy.io/site/login) (preferably using your Github account to authorize)
4. Clone your fork of this repo using the "Import Project" command. (Be sure to select "Github" as the source, then click the "Load Repo" button to load a list of your existing repos.
5. Open the `index.html` file and replace "Jane Student" with your own name. (Or, if your name is "Jane Student," replace it with the name of your favorite fictional character.)
6. Save your work and preview it by right-clicking on the filename and selecting "Preview."
7. Make any other changes you wish to the file. Experiment with some HTML if you want. Show off!
8. Once you are satisfied with your changes, save the file and right-click on the project directory (`wats3010-hello-world`), select `Git`, then select `commit`. 
9. Be sure the `index.html` file is selected for committing. Write a commit message that describes the changes you made. Be sure to check the box next to "Push committed changes to `origin/master`" so it will push these changes to your Github copy of the repository.
10. Go back to Github to verify the changes have shown up in your `master` branch files (you should be able to click into `index.html` to see them). 
11. Click on the `settings` tab and scroll down to the "Github Pages" section. Under "Source", select `master branch` and click the "Save" button. The page will refresh, and if you scroll down to the Github Pages section again it should show the URL where your site is deployed. Copy that URL before you click it to verify it is working.
12. The URL you just copied is the one you want to submit as the "deployed" URL to your project. You can also paste it into the description of your repository so it shows up when somebody views your source code.

This sounds like a lot, but these are small steps. You are encouraged to watch the video demo linked on the assignment resources page for more information about how to complete each of these steps.
